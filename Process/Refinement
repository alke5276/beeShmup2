Which of Fullerton's Formal Elements are you working with?

I think the game is going to be a primary focus on a single player versus the game. There will be no time limit but as the time goes on, more and more bees will draw more and more hornets, making the game more challenging to correctly shoot a hornet over a bee. 

What kinds of puzzles or player challenges might you include?

A player challenege I have is the opportunity to switch between the dart gun and the smoke gun. This makes it challene=ging to protect the bees if they try to attck you (if the player shoots the bees). There will also be a challenge of shooting the hornets without shooting a bee. 

What are the basic rules for your game?

Some of the basic rules I want to incoorperate in my game would be;
  - can shoot both bees and hornets but you don't want to shoot the bees
  - can switch between smoke and a dart gun, smoke for bees, dart gun for honets
  - can collect honey to level up
  - cannot use smokeing gun and dart gun at same time
  - must protect the bee hive
  - can move around the beekeepiing farm in an y direction to protect bees
  - must be facing enemy to shoot at them
  - must not get stung by bees or hornets
