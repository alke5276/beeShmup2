# 09/23/20 - Beginning Thoughts (Brainstorming)
# Shmup Repo and Initial Steps

For today's assignment, we were tasked with creating a GitHub repository for this game, a process section, and an initial post discussing the brainstorming that led to our final ideas.

For this project, I am interested in primarily focussing on my idea of a beekeeping game. The initial idea submitted was:

Getting pollen to bees before they sting you, catching honey - power-ups, or defending bee hive from hornets, but you canâ€™t hit the bees otherwise they all turn on you too, bigger boss could be a honey bear coming to steal hives, playing as a beekeeper, playing as the honey-bear if bees are an enemy

I like the idea of having multiple enemies should you accidentally hit a bee. It may offer an option to then also switch between say darts that kill the hornets but smoke to just settle angry bees. I also think using a collection of honey to fill up some sort of power up bar would be an interesting mechanic. I haven't decided yet how or if the bees will have the pollen given to them from the player. The player may place flowers to give bees pollen to make honey or may just be a guard against the attackers. 

To organize this game, I will need to create bees, hornets and or bears, beekeeper(player), honey, darts and or smoke, along with a health level 9bees and player) and a honey level. There would probably also need to be a game object for a honey house for the bees so that when the hornets get to the house, we loose bee health. 

If the player gets too close to the hornets they might follow the player? The only thing to make the bees go after the player would be if the player accidentally shoots a dart at a bee. 

The player must also then have the ability to run around the screen, possibly turning to shoot at hornets or bears, but especially in both the x and y plane.
